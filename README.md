# kaggle_titanic

This repository is my first real implication on a kaggle competition. All others end up to dropped notebooks 
and it has been 3 months i don't touch pandas and so on...

Here i want to make a robust pipeline as a test for later competitions. It has to train a model and submit data.
Moreover it has to make continuous training test and each version of the model has to be saved for later inspection.

# How to read this repository

First, look at the jupyter notebooks which is a draft of my final model, then go into code.

# What am i expecting from this competition

I would like to set up pipelines which will structure the model because i figured out that it was a real challenge back in industry.

# Packages

I will certainly use Pandas as a basic package for data exploration and sklearn. 
I also would like to be introduced to JAX or go deeper to tensorflow probability.
